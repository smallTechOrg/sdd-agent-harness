# AI Agent Rules

**These rules apply to every AI coding session in this repo — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other AI assistant.**

Read this file completely before doing anything else.

---

## ⚠ Non-Negotiable Rules

These rules are never optional, never skipped, and must survive context compression. If your context window is compressed and you can only remember a few rules, these are the ones.

1. **README must always be accurate.** Every command in the README must work exactly as written, from the directory stated. Before ending any session or marking any phase complete: run the README commands yourself — if any fail, fix the README first. A README that lies is worse than no README.

2. **Never claim a test passed if you didn't run it.** "It should work" is not a passing test. Run `pytest` (or equivalent). Show the output. If you can't run it, say so — do not fabricate results.

3. **All commands in docs use the package manager prefix.** For Python + uv projects: every `alembic`, `pytest`, `python` command in the README and docs must be prefixed with `uv run`. Bare commands (e.g. `alembic upgrade head`) fail unless the venv is manually activated — which users won't do.

4. **Working directory must be explicit.** Any README or doc section with shell commands must state the exact working directory at the top of the code block. "Run from project root" is not enough — give the exact relative path from the repo root.

5. **No SQLite substitute for PostgreSQL tests.** If the production database is PostgreSQL, tests run against PostgreSQL. Tests that only pass on SQLite do not count as passing.

6. **Golden-path UI smoke test is mandatory before Phase 2 passes.** If the project has any UI or HTTP surface, Phase 2 must include an automated test that walks the full primary user journey via `TestClient` (or equivalent) and asserts **response content**, not just status codes. See `spec/engineering/workflows/golden-path-smoke-test.md`. A build that returns 200 but renders a broken-looking page is a failing build.

7. **Stub / offline providers must be clearly signalled in the UI.** If an LLM provider is stubbed (no key, demo mode), the UI must display a visible banner on every page. Silent stubs that look like real output are a bug — users will report "it didn't work." The provider should auto-select real when an API key is present (`provider=auto` → real when key set, stub otherwise). Never require the user to flip a flag *in addition* to setting the key.

8. **Stub LLM outputs must be distinct per pipeline node and article-shaped.** Pipeline nodes that share a stub provider must inject unambiguous tags (e.g. `<node:plan>`, `<node:draft>`, `<node:title>`) into their prompts, and the stub must branch on those tags — never on prose keywords from the prompt body (keyword matching cross-contaminates: the word "outline" in a draft prompt must not cause the stub to emit outline bullets instead of a draft). Stub "draft" output must contain paragraphs/headings, not just bullets, so offline demos are credible.

9. **Any agent interacting with external providers must use a ReAct loop — never a single-shot pipeline.** If the agent's job requires calling any external provider (data sources, APIs, services, or compute engines), it must plan tool calls, execute them through the tool abstraction, observe results, and loop iteratively until the LLM signals a final answer. A single-shot pipeline cannot chain dependent calls, cannot retry on tool failure, and cannot self-correct when a provider returns unexpected output. The correct pattern — plan tool call → invoke tool → observe result → loop until done — must be specced in `07-agent-graph.md` before any code is written. See Section 10 of this file for the full pattern.

10. **Every commit must be pushed immediately.** `git commit` and `git push` are a single atomic action — never one without the other. Use `git commit -m "..." && git push origin <branch>` as a single command. A commit that is not pushed does not exist as far as the project is concerned. This is not optional and is not context-compression-safe — if you remember only this sentence: **commit then push, every time, no exceptions.**

11. **`main` is boilerplate-only. Never commit application code to `main`.** All application code lives on a named feature branch and reaches `main` only via a reviewed pull request. This rule has no exceptions:
    - Before writing any application code, create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<slug>-v0.1`
    - All phase commits go to the feature branch, never to `main`
    - Spec/engineering/boilerplate improvements (no app code) are the only commits that may go directly to `main`
    - When the build is complete, open a PR from the feature branch into `main` — do not merge locally
    - If you find yourself on `main` while writing application code, stop immediately, create the feature branch, and continue there

12. **A PR must exist before the first feature-branch commit, and every push must go to that PR.** After creating the feature branch and pushing the first commit, immediately open a PR: `gh pr create --base main --head feature/<slug>-v0.1`. Every subsequent `git push` automatically updates the same PR — no extra step needed — but the PR must be open. Pushing commits without an open PR is equivalent to committing without pushing: the work is invisible and unreviable. This is not optional and survives context compression.

## 1. Session Start Checklist

Complete all steps in order before writing any code:

- [ ] Read `spec/product/01-vision.md` — know what you're building
- [ ] Check if the spec is complete (no `<!-- FILL IN -->` markers in product spec files)
  - If incomplete: surface the agent-builder to the user; do not write application code
- [ ] If spec is complete: read the full spec manifest in `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Run `git status` — working tree must be clean before starting
- [ ] **Create and switch to a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/<slug>-v0.1` — **never build on `main`**
- [ ] **Create the project directory** `<agent-slug>/` if it doesn't exist — never write agent code into the boilerplate root
- [ ] Open a session report: `<agent-slug>/reports/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[branch].md` — **must exist before Phase 1 starts**
  - Use the template in `spec/engineering/workflows/session-report.md`
- [ ] Confirm which phase you are implementing (see `spec/engineering/phases.md`)

## 2. Session Report (Mandatory)

Every session must have a report at `reports/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[branch].md`.

Minimum required sections:
- **Goal:** What this session is trying to accomplish
- **Phase:** Which implementation phase
- **Steps completed:** Logged as you work (not reconstructed at the end)
- **Prompt log:** Every user message and a one-line summary of your action
- **Next steps:** What remains

Update the report in real time. Do not reconstruct it from memory at the end.

## 3. Gate Law

The goal is: **one prompt → working skeleton in ~10 minutes.** All decisions are captured upfront and approved once. There is exactly one user approval gate before code is written.

```
INTAKE (4 questions: scope, stack, trigger, constraints)
        ↓
DRAFT (spec + tech design + plan produced together)
        ↓
ONE APPROVAL (user sees everything at once — one response to proceed)
        ↓
BUILD (Phase 1 → Phase 2, each gated by passing tests)
```

**Rules that never change:**
- Stack decisions (database, language, hosting) belong to the user — captured at intake, never chosen autonomously
- No code is written before the single approval gate is cleared
- Each build phase must pass its gate test before the next phase starts
- Reviewers (spec-reviewer, plan-reviewer) run as background validation and surface blockers, but do not add approval rounds for v0.1

**After v0.1 is running**, subsequent phases follow the standard gate:
```
[Phase implemented] → [gate test passes] → [committed] → [next phase]
```

---

## 4. Spec-First Rule

**No code change without a spec backing it.**

If you are asked to implement something not in the spec:
1. Stop
2. Tell the user what spec gap you found
3. Propose adding it to the spec first
4. Wait for approval before writing code

See `spec/engineering/spec-driven.md` for full details.

## 5. Phase Discipline

**Never start phase N+1 while phase N is incomplete or failing.**

Each phase ends when:
- All code for that phase is written and committed
- All tests for that phase pass
- The qa-auditor sub-agent has signed off (or you have run the QA checklist manually)

See `spec/engineering/phases.md` for the phase definitions and gates.

## 6. Git Discipline

- Commit every logical unit of work — never let the working tree stay dirty for more than one logical change
- **Push immediately after every commit** — treat `git commit -m "..." && git push origin <branch>` as a single indivisible command. Never leave a commit unpushed.
- Commit message format: `phase-N: [what you did]` (e.g., `phase-1: add domain models`)
- Never commit secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Never force-push without user confirmation
- **Never `git add -A` / `git add .`** — always stage specific files or directories. `-A` sweeps in untracked leftovers from prior build attempts (stray packages, abandoned experiments) and poisons the commit. If a phase needs many files, list them explicitly or stage directories one at a time.

**Before every reply to the user:**
1. Run `git status`
2. If dirty: commit the changes with `git commit -m "..." && git push origin <branch>`
3. Confirm the working tree is clean **and** the branch is pushed before replying

## 7. Test Before Claiming Done

A phase is not done until tests pass. "It looks right" is not a test.

- Write tests for each capability as you implement it
- Run the full test suite before marking a phase complete
- If tests fail, fix them before moving on

## 8. Error Resilience

Every external call (API, database, LLM) must have:
- Error handling that doesn't crash the agent
- Logged failures (to file or stdout at minimum)
- Graceful degradation (the agent continues if a non-critical step fails)

## 9. No Gold-Plating

Build what the spec says, nothing more.

- No extra features "while you're in there"
- No refactoring outside the current phase scope
- No premature abstractions
- If you spot a future improvement, add it to `reports/sessions/[current].md` under "Future improvements" and keep moving

## 10. ReAct Loop + Tool Invocation

Every agent that interacts with an external provider must implement a ReAct (Reason + Act) loop that invokes tools. This section defines both the loop mechanics and the Tool abstraction that `invoke_tool` executes.

### When to use a ReAct loop

Use a ReAct loop whenever the agent must interact with **any external provider** to complete its task:

- **Data providers:** databases, CSV files, search indices, vector stores
- **Service providers:** REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, email, messaging, calendar, CRM
- **Compute providers:** code execution, image generation, document processing, web scraping

**Never** design a single-shot pipeline when the agent needs to interact with an external provider ("build a prompt and return whatever the LLM says"). Single-shot pipelines cannot chain dependent calls, cannot retry on tool failure, and cannot self-correct when a provider returns unexpected output.

### The canonical ReAct loop shape

Tool loading and session setup happen **before** the loop — they are not nodes in the loop graph:

```
[pre-loop: register tools, load session context into AgentState]
          │
          ▼
plan_action ◄──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                                │
  ├──(LLM failure) ──────► handle_error            │
  │                                                │
  ├──(FINAL ANSWER signal) ─► finalize ──► END     │
  │                                                │
  └──(tool call) ──────────► invoke_tool ──────────┘
                                  │
                                  ├──(fatal: infra failure) ─► handle_error
                                  │
                                  └──(tool error: feed back to LLM for self-correction)
```

`invoke_tool` is the single node responsible for all tool execution — every interaction with every external provider is dispatched through here. See the Tool Invocation section below.

### Termination protocol (mandatory)

The LLM must have an unambiguous way to signal it is done. Define this in the spec before writing code:

```
FINAL ANSWER: <the complete answer text here>
```

`plan_action` checks if the LLM response starts with `FINAL ANSWER:` (case-insensitive). If yes, strip the prefix and route to `finalize`. If no, parse the response as a tool call and route to `invoke_tool`.

This is not optional — without a termination signal, the loop runs until max iterations.

### Max iterations guard (mandatory)

Every ReAct loop must have a configurable ceiling:

```python
max_agent_iterations: int = Field(default=10)
```

After `invoke_tool` increments `iteration_count`, check:
```python
if iteration_count >= max_iterations:
    return {**state, "error": f"Max iterations ({max_iterations}) reached"}
```

Route to `handle_error`. Never let a loop run unboundedly.

---

### Tool anatomy

A **Tool** is a named, typed, executable unit that the LLM invokes during the ReAct loop. Every external interaction the agent performs must be modelled as a Tool — there is no other channel for the agent to interact with the outside world.

Every tool has the same structure:

```
Tool
  ├── id           — unique identifier (UUID)
  ├── name         — snake_case label shown to the LLM (e.g. "weather_api", "send_email")
  ├── type         — implementation type that determines which executor runs it
  ├── description  — one sentence shown to the LLM in the planning prompt
  ├── config_json  — type-specific runtime config (base URL, credentials ref, table name, etc.)
  └── capabilities — one or more named actions the tool exposes
        └── Capability
              ├── name              — the callable action (e.g. "get", "search", "send")
              ├── description       — shown to the LLM
              └── parameter_schema  — JSON Schema dict describing the parameters
```

Store Tool and Capability records in the application database. Do not hardcode them in the agent source.

### Tool categories

| Category | Example types | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Data source** | `csv_query`, `sql_query`, `vector_search`, `graphql_query` | Agent reads or queries external data |
| **External action** | `http_request`, `send_email`, `post_webhook`, `write_file` | Agent affects the outside world |
| **Compute** | `python_eval`, `shell_exec` | Agent runs calculations or scripts (sandbox required) |
| **Orchestration** | `sub_agent` | Master agent delegates to a child agent; receives a response |

Agents always have access to multiple tools. The assumption is that a session's tool list contains everything the agent needs — scoping is done at registration time, not at invocation time.

### Sub-agents as tools

A tool can itself be an AI agent. When a master agent needs to delegate a task — parallel research, specialist reasoning, a scoped sub-problem — it invokes a `sub_agent` tool exactly like any other tool: by naming it and passing a prompt as a parameter.

```json
{"tool": "market_analyst_agent", "capability": "analyze", "parameters": {"prompt": "What is the 30-day trend for AAPL?"}}
```

The sub-agent tool:
- Receives the prompt (and optionally structured context from the parent's state)
- Runs its own internal loop — which may itself call tools or spawn further sub-agents
- Returns a response string to the parent agent
- Is opaque to the parent: the parent sees a result, not the sub-agent's internal reasoning

This enables hierarchical agent architectures:

```
Master agent
  ├── invoke_tool("market_analyst_agent", prompt) → runs own loop → returns analysis
  ├── invoke_tool("travel_agent", prompt)         → runs own loop → returns recommendation
  └── FINAL ANSWER: <combined decision using both results>
```

Register sub-agents in the Tool Registry the same way as any other tool — with a capability name (`analyze`, `research`, `summarize`, etc.) and a parameter schema that includes at least a `prompt` field.

### Tool Registry pattern

Tools are registered when a user connects a provider — not at agent startup:

```
User connects a provider
(uploads a file, provides an API endpoint, enters credentials, etc.)
         ↓
System creates a Tool record (name, type, description, config)
         ↓
System creates Capability records (one per action the tool exposes)
         ↓
Tool is available to any session that includes this provider
```

Before the ReAct loop starts, all Tool + Capability records for the session are loaded from the DB into `AgentState`. This lets the agent discover its tools at runtime — no hardcoded tool list in agent code.

`AgentState` must carry the loaded tools list:

```python
tools: list[dict]  # [{"name", "type", "config", "capabilities": [{"name", "description", "parameter_schema"}]}]
```

### LLM response modes

The LLM can respond in two modes. Decide which mode(s) the agent supports in `07-agent-graph.md` before writing any code; the `plan_action` prompt must instruct the LLM accordingly.

**Mode 1 — Single tool call**

The LLM invokes one tool and waits for the result before deciding the next step. Use this mode when steps are sequential and each depends on the previous result.

```json
{"tool": "weather_api", "capability": "get_forecast", "parameters": {"city": "London"}}
```

**Mode 2 — Execution plan**

The LLM emits a structured workflow that the runtime executes — with parallel branches, conditional routing, sub-agent invocations, and join strategies. Use this mode when tasks can be parallelised or when the overall workflow has branching logic too complex to reason about linearly.

```yaml
id: market_and_travel_analyzer
states:
  fork_research:
    type: parallel
    branches:
      - id: stock_branch
        states:
          fetch_stock:
            type: tool_call
            tool: get_stock_ticker
            parameters: { ticker: "AAPL" }
      - id: travel_branch
        states:
          fetch_flights:
            type: tool_call
            tool: get_flight_price
            parameters: { destination: "SFO" }
    join:
      strategy: all        # wait for all branches; "race" = first-wins
      next: evaluate

  evaluate:
    type: reasoning
    instructions: "Review stock trend and flight price. Decide whether to book."
    next: decide

  decide:
    type: switch
    expression: "stock_trend == 'bullish' && flight_price < 400"
    cases:
      true:  complete
      false: abort
```

Execution plan node types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `tool_call` | Invoke a single tool capability with parameters |
| `parallel` | Fork into concurrent branches; join by `all` (wait for all) or `race` (first wins) |
| `reasoning` | Pass intermediate results back to the LLM for a reasoning step |
| `switch` | Conditional branch based on an expression over accumulated context |
| `end` | Terminal state — success or failure with an optional reason |

### Tool invocation (`invoke_tool`)

`invoke_tool` resolves the named tool from the session's registry, then calls the appropriate capability method on that tool instance with the provided parameters. Each tool encapsulates its own internal implementation — the harness does not prescribe how a specific tool type queries a provider or manages connections. That is the tool's responsibility.

For **single tool calls** (Mode 1), `invoke_tool` calls the capability, captures the result or error, appends it to `tool_call_history`, and returns to `plan_action`.

For **execution plans** (Mode 2), a plan executor interprets the plan graph: launching parallel branches as concurrent tasks, waiting at join points per the join strategy (`all` / `race`), routing through conditionals, and invoking sub-agents as opaque tool calls. The master agent receives only the final output of each branch — not the sub-agent's internal trace.

`invoke_tool` must never raise. Any failure is captured as a `tool_call_history` entry with `is_error: True` and returned to `plan_action` for self-correction, unless the failure is infrastructure-level (see Self-correction below).

### Self-correction on tool errors

When a tool call fails, **do not immediately fail the pipeline**. Instead:

1. Append the failed call and its error to `tool_call_history` in state, flagged as `is_error: True`
2. Increment `iteration_count`
3. Route back to `plan_action`

The prompt for the next `plan_action` call shows the error inline:

```
[2] Tool: weather_api | Capability: get_forecast | Parameters: {"city": "Londn"}
    Error: City not found. Check the spelling and try again.
    → This tool call failed. Correct it and try again.
```

**Recoverable — feed back and loop:**
- Tool execution errors (bad parameters, validation failure, 4xx from a provider)
- Malformed or non-JSON LLM response (ask the LLM to reformat)
- Unknown capability name (tell the LLM the valid capability list)
- Tool parameter validation failure (show the parameter schema; ask the LLM to retry)

**Fatal — route to `handle_error` immediately:**
- Max iterations reached
- LLM call itself fails (network error, 5xx)
- Infrastructure failure in tool executor (provider unreachable, credentials revoked)

The key principle: **if the LLM could correct the mistake given better information, feed back and loop. Only fail when the environment itself is broken.**

### Prompting the LLM about available tools

The `plan_action` prompt must list every available tool and capability, specify the response mode(s) the agent supports, and show the exact format for each mode.

**Minimum required elements:**
- Every tool: name, description, each capability with its parameter schema
- Sub-agent tools listed the same way as regular tools (name, capability, prompt parameter)
- The exact invocation format for the supported mode(s) — never leave format ambiguous
- The FINAL ANSWER signal on the same page so the LLM sees all three options together
- Real names for everything (actual tool names, actual API endpoints) — no generic placeholders

**Example prompt block (Mode 1 + sub-agent):**

```
Available tools:

Tool: weather_api  — Get conditions and forecasts from the weather service.
  Capability: get_forecast
    Parameters:
      city  (string, required)  — City name.
      days  (integer, optional) — Forecast days (default: 3).

Tool: market_analyst_agent  — Specialist agent for equity analysis.
  Capability: analyze
    Parameters:
      prompt  (string, required)  — Analysis question to answer.

To invoke a tool:
{"tool": "<name>", "capability": "<capability>", "parameters": {...}}

To emit an execution plan (use when tasks can run in parallel):
{"type": "parallel", "branches": [...], "join": {"strategy": "all", "next": "<state>"}, ...}

When you have enough information to answer:
FINAL ANSWER: <your complete answer here>
```

### Tool call history in AgentState

The running log of tool calls and their results must live in state so the full context is available on every `plan_action` call:

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict, total=False):
    ...
    tools: list[dict]              # loaded before loop starts
    tool_call_history: list[dict]  # [{"tool": str, "capability": str, "parameters": dict, "result": str, "is_error": bool}]
    iteration_count: int
    llm_response: str              # raw last LLM output — router inspects this for FINAL ANSWER
```

Persist `tool_call_history` to the database as JSON so it can be surfaced in the UI as an agent reasoning trace.

### Security boundaries (non-negotiable)

- **Data source tools:** Enforce read-only at the executor level. Any write attempt must be rejected as a recoverable error — never passed to the provider. Log every rejection.
- **External action tools** (`send_email`, `post_webhook`, `write_file`): Require explicit user opt-in in the UI before the session starts if the action is irreversible. Log every execution with its parameters.
- **Compute tools** (`python_eval`, `shell_exec`): Require a sandboxed executor. Never enable by default. Explicitly excluded from v0.1 scope unless the spec requires them.

### What to spec in 07-agent-graph.md before writing code

Before writing any node code, `07-agent-graph.md` must answer:

1. **Which LLM response mode(s) does this agent support?** Single tool call, execution plan, or both — and what is the exact format for each.
2. What is the exact FINAL ANSWER signal string?
3. What constitutes a recoverable tool error vs a fatal error?
4. What is the max iterations default?
5. What fields does `AgentState` carry for tool call history and iteration count?
6. **What tools does the agent have access to?** — name, type, category, capabilities, and parameter schemas for every tool, including any sub-agent tools.
7. **What triggers tool registration?** — the user action (file upload, API key entry, sub-agent configuration, etc.) that creates a Tool record.

If any of these are missing from the spec, raise a blocker before Phase 2 starts.

---

## 11. When Stuck

If requirements are unclear:
1. Stop
2. List your specific questions in the session report
3. Ask the user — do not guess

If the spec is ambiguous:
1. State the ambiguity
2. Propose an interpretation
3. Wait for confirmation before implementing

## 12. Closing a Session

Before ending a session:
- [ ] Working tree is clean (all changes committed and pushed)
- [ ] Session report is complete and up to date
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] `README.md` updated if project layout, setup steps, or commands changed
- [ ] Note which phase you're on and what comes next in the session report
