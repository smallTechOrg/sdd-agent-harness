# Session Report — 2026-06-23 15:25:55 — feature/data-analysis-agent-v0.1

## Goal

Formalize the hand-rolled "tools-as-data" registry as the real Model Context Protocol: each
uploaded CSV becomes an in-process MCP server (official `mcp` SDK 1.28.0) wrapping its Parquet
file via DuckDB; the agent talks to those servers as an MCP client.

## Phase

Phase 0 — Spec sync + dependency spike (precedes the 3 implementation phases in the approved plan).

## Session Start State

- Branch: feature/data-analysis-agent-v0.1 (pushed; no PR yet)
- Last commit: be37336 refactor: modularise codebase — one responsibility per file, methods <=25 lines
- Tests: assumed passing (will confirm at each gate)
- Untracked, unrelated: handbook.docx, handbook.md, screenshots/ — NOT part of this work, never staged.

## Approved Plan

`/Users/tamo/.claude/plans/jaunty-sleeping-dusk.md`. Locked decisions: in-process in-memory MCP
transport; one MCP server per data source; DuckDB over Parquet; official MCP SDK only
(no langchain-mcp-adapters); spec-first then full migration in 4 phases.

---

## Steps Completed

- [x] Read full spec manifest + current code (architecture, agent-graph, tool registry, execution, ingester, nodes, datasources)
- [x] Researched official MCP Python SDK 1.28.0 (FastMCP, ClientSession, in-memory transport, structuredContent)
- [x] Confirmed async/sync boundary: sync pipeline on a daemon thread → run_pipeline owns one asyncio.run loop
- [x] Verified env: langgraph 1.2.5, anyio 4.13.0; mcp/duckdb absent; alembic head 57cfed820d74
- [x] Wrote + got approval on the implementation plan
- [x] Opened this session report
- [x] Phase 0: rewrote specs for MCP/DuckDB (vision, architecture, data-model, agent-graph, api, capabilities 00/01/02, tech-stack)
- [x] Phase 0: added `mcp==1.28.0` + `duckdb>=1.1,<2` (installed mcp 1.28.0, duckdb 1.5.4); `uv sync` ok
- [x] Phase 0: spike PASSED — see findings below

### Phase 0 spike findings (de-risked the design)

- In-memory helper `create_connected_server_and_client_session(FastMCP)` yields an **already-initialized** session (no manual `initialize()`).
- FastMCP **auto-generates `inputSchema`** from `run_query(query: str)`: `{"properties":{"query":{"title":"Query","type":"string"}},"required":["query"],...}`.
- DuckDB over Parquet works; native `STDDEV`/`MEDIAN` confirmed → custom SQLite aggregates can be deleted.
- **A raised `ValueError` inside the tool → `CallToolResult.isError=True`** (text prefixed `"Error executing tool run_query: ..."`), NOT propagated across the transport. So recoverable errors = raise; no sentinel fallback needed.
- Bad SQL → DuckDB binder error → `isError=True` (recoverable, with candidate-binding hints).
- **Impl notes for later phases:** (1) version guard must use `importlib.metadata.version("mcp")` — there is no `mcp.__version__`; (2) DuckDB DDL rejects bind params — inline the (escaped) Parquet path in `CREATE VIEW ... read_parquet('...')`; (3) `structuredContent` auto-populates as `{"result": <csv str>}`; we read `content[0].text`.

### Phase 1 — Data model + migration + registration (DONE, gate green)

- Dropped `ToolRow`/`ToolCapabilityRow` (db) and `Tool`/`ToolCapability` (domain); added `tool_description`/`capability_description` columns to `DataSourceRow`.
- Alembic migration `b8e1f0a2c3d4` (down_revision `57cfed820d74`): add cols → back-fill from old tables → drop `tool_capabilities` + `tools`. Reversible downgrade recreates + restores. **Round-trip verified** (upgrade head / downgrade -1 / upgrade head on a temp DB).
- `api/datasources.py`: upload/sync now write the two description columns; delete no longer touches tool tables; removed `_register_tool`/`_build_capability`/`_apply_descriptions`/`_delete_tools` + unused imports.
- `graph/tool_registry.py`: Phase-1 **shim** — synthesises the legacy nested tool dict from the description columns so the existing sync SQLite pipeline still answers queries unchanged (removed in Phase 3).
- Tests updated (drop tool/cap tests, add description-column test, fixture sets description cols). **`uv run pytest` = 20 passed** (incl. golden path + direct `run_pipeline`). Imports clean.
- Deferred to Phase 3: dead `{% if tool %}` block in `datasource.html` (confirmed never rendered — no route passes `tool`).

### Phase 2 — MCP server + client pool (DONE, gate green)

- **Important finding (the #1 risk, resolved):** a spike with a real LangGraph async graph proved LangGraph runs **each node in its own asyncio task**. Holding an MCP `ClientSession` (async CM) open across nodes raises `RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task`. So the original "AsyncExitStack held across nodes" design is **invalid**.
- **Design correction (spec updated):** the per-`run_id` pool holds only **plain objects across nodes** (the built `FastMCP` servers + their DuckDB connections); every `ClientSession` is **transient** — opened/closed within a single node. Verified by a second spike (per-node sessions + server reuse + cross-node conn cleanup, 3 repeated runs). Updated `02-architecture.md` + `07-agent-graph.md` accordingly.
- `graph/mcp/csv_server.py`: `build_server(source, capability_description, max_rows)` → `FastMCP` wrapping one Parquet via a read-only DuckDB view named `sql_table_name(name)`; `run_query` tool; SELECT-only + DuckDB errors raise `RecoverableQueryError` → `isError=True`; missing Parquet raises `FileNotFoundError` (fatal). DuckDB path inlined+escaped (DDL can't bind params).
- `graph/mcp_pool.py`: the ONLY importer of `mcp.shared.memory`; version guard via `importlib.metadata.version("mcp")` (1.x); `open_pool`/`get_pool`/`close_pool` + `McpPool` (namespaced tool keys `<table>__run_query`, routing, idempotent close, partial-open cleanup).
- `config/settings.py`: added `mcp_max_result_rows` (default 200).
- New isolated tests `tests/unit/graph/test_csv_server.py` (7) + `test_mcp_pool.py` (3) via the real in-memory MCP client. **Full suite: 30 passed** (graph still on the Phase-1 shim — no wiring yet).

### Phase 3 — Async graph cutover (DONE, gate green)

- 5 graph nodes → `async def`; `runner.run_pipeline` stays sync but drives `asyncio.run(agent_graph.ainvoke(...))` with a `try/finally: await close_pool` backstop.
- `load_data` → `open_pool` + `pool.list_tools()`; `execute_action` → `await pool.call_tool(...)`; `finalize`/`handle_error` → `await close_pool`.
- `tool_registry.py` shim removed → `load_sources_for_session()` (sources only, with computed `table_name`).
- `execution.py` rewritten to parse `{"tool","arguments"}` (SQLite executor deleted); `planning.py` → DuckDB dialect + namespaced tool names + `{"tool","arguments"}`; `state.py` comments updated; `stub.py` → `{"tool","arguments"}` + `[1] tool:` sentinel.
- Templates: `session.html` trace now reads `step.tool`/`step.arguments`; removed the dead `{% if tool %}` block in `datasource.html`.
- **Deleted** `graph/loading.py`, `graph/data_cache.py`, `graph/sql_aggregates.py`.
- `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py` fixture now writes a real Parquet via `FileIngester` (CSV fallback gone); `run_pipeline` stays sync so the direct call is unchanged.
- README updated for the MCP/DuckDB stack (Gemini/OpenRouter drift left as-is, out of scope).
- **Gate:** `uv run pytest` = **30 passed** in stub mode (real MCP+DuckDB E2E). **Live smoke** (`uv run python -m data_analysis_agent`, port 8001): `/health` 200, upload → session → **3 queries all completed**, **no loop/task/cancel-scope errors** in the log. `alembic heads` = `b8e1f0a2c3d4`.

## Prompt Log

| Time | User Message | Action Taken |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 15:0x | "Rethink the codebase from MCP stack; tools are MCP clients; CSV upload creates an internal MCP server wrapping the Parquet; use official MCP SDK only." | Explored code + SDK, planned the migration, got plan approved, started Phase 0. |

---

## Decisions Made

- Tool-call format switches to MCP-native `{"tool","arguments"}` (was `{"capability","parameters"}`) — flagged in plan, approved.
- MCP Tool flattens the old two-level Tool→Capability; `tools`/`tool_capabilities` tables dropped; LLM descriptions move to `data_sources` columns.
- In-memory helper `create_connected_server_and_client_session` is semi-public → isolated behind `graph/mcp_pool.py`; `mcp==1.28.0` pinned exactly.

## Future Improvements

- Optional Phase 4 polish: settings-driven row cap, structlog fields for MCP open/close, README architecture diagram, version guard hardening.
- Pre-existing spec/code drift (tech-stack says google-genai; code uses openai/OpenRouter) — out of scope here.

## Session End State

- Branch: feature/data-analysis-agent-v0.1 (PR #57 → main, smallTechOrg/zero-shot-sdd-harness).
- All 4 phases complete (0 spec+spike, 1 data model, 2 MCP server+pool, 3 async cutover). Each committed + pushed; tests green at every gate.
- Tests: `uv run pytest` = 30 passed (stub mode, full MCP+DuckDB pipeline). Live server smoke passed (3 repeated queries, no loop errors).
- The tool layer is now real MCP (official `mcp` 1.28.0): per-source in-process FastMCP servers over DuckDB/Parquet; agent is the MCP client. `tools`/`tool_capabilities` tables gone.
- Next: PR review/merge. Out of scope (noted): Gemini-vs-OpenRouter spec/README drift; optional Phase-4 polish (structlog MCP fields, README architecture diagram).
